## version three is ready! (/≧▽≦)/

------- *the dev branch is for the code updates. will let my stable codes in this branch after i'm done with them*



# versions details:
## v3:
  this version uses two methods, 1 for the structure (a, operator, b, result), 2 for the structure (a, b, operatpr, result).
  in this version, the java level is also more advance than in v1 (it's not so advanced like a real programmer).

  you can get to know the version more by checking the codes at `v3` folder.

  NOTE: i got some help from chatgpt in this code (BUT THERE AREN'T ANY DIRECT COPY-PASTES)
  
  **CONTRIBUTION**: if you would like to contribute, you can find what's needed in `v3.java`. for lazy ppl:
  "if i would like to do something further to this version, it would be to  add something makes the code get the user to the beginning of the case instead of the beginning of the whole program if they entered an invalid operator (or maybe even invalid inputs as the numbers (tbh i didn't even try that yet))"
  
  _!uses terminal!_

## v2: (-down-)
  this version was planned to be a gui version, but got some difficulties during the process. - it's down for now

## v1:
  this version is the first and simplist version. it uses the terminal and only integers.
